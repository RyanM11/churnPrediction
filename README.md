# churnPrediction
In today's highly competitive business landscape, customer retention has become a critical factor for the long-term success of any organization. Customer churn, which refers to the phenomenon of customers discontinuing their relationship with a company, can significantly impact the financial performance and growth prospects of a business. To mitigate this risk, companies are increasingly turning to predictive analytics and machine learning techniques to identify potential churners and take proactive measures to retain them.

The primary objective of this project is to develop an accurate and reliable model that can predict customer churn with a high degree of precision. By leveraging historical customer data and employing advanced machine learning algorithms, we aim to identify early warning signs and key indicators that are strongly associated with churn behavior. This will enable businesses to proactively intervene and implement targeted retention strategies, thereby reducing churn rates and improving customer loyalty.
